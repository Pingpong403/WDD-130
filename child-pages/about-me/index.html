                    I grew up in Modesto, CA. The town is pretty big, so when we 
                    moved around throughout my childhood I got to see all the 
                    different facets of the town; from the wild west southern 
                    portions to the more sophisticated northern bits. My family
                    is 100% redheaded! Both my parents are the only ones
                    in their immediate families endowed with such a splendid hair
                    pigment. They therefore passed that down to all of their
                    children. Speaking of, there are 5 of us. I am the second
                    oldest, and the only boy. That means that I grew up
                    watching a lot of Barbie movies with my sisters and being
                    pestered endlessly by their antics. I also was the favored one,
                    as I didn't annoy my parents with any unsolicited moods.

            <h3>My Mission</h2>

                    I served in the Philippines, Baguio mission from October 2018
                    until March 2020. I think you can guess why I was sent home
                    early, 6 months before my expected return date. My mission was
                    a huge learning experience for me! Not only did I learn just
                    how important patience is, I also got to learn more about the
                    gospel, teach a bunch of cool people, and learn the nation's
                    language, Tagalog (mabuhay!).<br><br>

                    While the Philippines is a pretty hot place, there was one
                    place in my mission that was relatively cool, and that was the
                    actual name of the mission, Baguio city. Baguio city is cool
                    because the entire thing resides within the mountains. The trip
                    up there (usually by Partas buses) can be quite nauseating, but
                    once you're there, you get to enjoy the colder, wetter
                    environment and amazing views.

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>
                    I have always been a musical fellow. My mom put my sister and
                    me into piano lessons when we were super young, which
                    taught me how to play "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" and nothing
                    else. That isn't to say that I gave up piano forever. Later
                    in life I took it up again, resolute in my decision to teach
                    myself how to play. I didn't actually make much progress with
                    that until my mission, where I decided to play piano for my
                    first ward. I was terrible at the time, but through sheer
                    determination I was able to become a lot better throughout my
                    mission. I have been practicing ever since and am now the
                    full-time pianist for my current ward!<br><br>

                    I have also been playing an instrument since the 4th grade.
                    I started out on trumpet, which was an adventure. It taught me
                    the treble clef, which is what the right hand of piano songs
                    uses. It also paved the way for me to pick up the French Horn
                    in the 8th grade. The whole first month of playing, I had no
                    fingering charts, no idea what key the instrument was in, and
                    therefore sounded awful and did not play the right notes. That's
                    not even mentioning how relatively difficult the instrument is!
                    In the end, I was able to learn it and get pretty good, playing
                    it all through high school. I am finally picking it up again to
                    play in the University Band this semester.<br><br>

                    Other hobbies include playing video games, programming for fun,
                    and consuming top-notch media.
